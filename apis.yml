  SpaceAPI is a standardized interface for public and private space providers to
  share information about their spaces in a machine-readable format. It allows
  users to access real-time data about the availability, capacity, and amenities
  of various spaces, such as co-working spaces, maker spaces, and event venues.
  By providing this information in a uniform and easily accessible way, SpaceAPI
  helps individuals and organizations find and utilize spaces that meet their
  specific needs and requirements. Additionally, SpaceAPI promotes transparency
  and collaboration within the space-sharing community, enabling spaces to
  efficiently share resources and attract a wider range of users.
